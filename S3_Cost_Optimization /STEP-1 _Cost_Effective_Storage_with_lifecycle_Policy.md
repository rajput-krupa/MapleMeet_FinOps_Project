âœ… STEP 1: Enable Cost-Effective Storage with Lifecycle Policies
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Move old/inactive data to cheaper storage like S3 Infrequent Access or Glacier
ðŸ“¦ Use Case: Maple Meet stores event photos, forms, user docs. But not all data needs frequent access.

ðŸ”§ What to Do:
ðŸ”¹ Create a Lifecycle Rule:
Go to your S3 bucket â†’ Management tab

Click "Create lifecycle rule"

Name: ArchiveOldData

Choose:

Apply to all objects (or by prefix like /images/, /backups/)

Transition settings:

After 30 days â†’ move to Infrequent Access (IA)

After 90 days â†’ move to Glacier Deep Archive

**This saves up to 80% on storage cost long-term.**



ðŸ“˜ Explanation:
ðŸŽ‰ Maple Meet might keep event images for records.

But old data doesnâ€™t need instant access â†’ so we optimize cost using lifecycle policies.

FinOps principle: Reduce cost without deleting useful data.
